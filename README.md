# Titanic Survival Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This data analytics project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates. The project covers various aspects, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required libraries installed before running the code. The primary libraries used in this project include:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main sections:

1. **Loading and Previewing the Data:**
   - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - An initial preview of the data is displayed using `head()`.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and perform necessary data cleaning steps.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset.
   - Visualize key features and relationships using various plots and graphs.

4. **Factor Plot Analysis:**
   - Utilize factor plots to analyze survival rates based on different factors such as class, gender, and age.

5. **Linear Plot Analysis:**
   - Implement linear plots to explore the relationship between age and survival, considering factors such as class, gender, and age generations.

6. **Saving Data to CSV:**
   - Demonstrate how to save a 2D array as a CSV file using NumPy.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Titanic-Survival-Analysis
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python Titanic_Survival_Analysis.py
   ```

   Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed for the first option.

4. Explore and customize the code based on your preferences and insights gained from the analysis.
